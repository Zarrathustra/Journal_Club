# Dynein Clusters into Lipid Microdomains on Phagosomes to Drive Rapid Transport toward Lysosome #

## Syntax ##

* EP: Early Phagosome
* LP: Late Phagosome

## Facts and Hypotheses ##

**Fact 1**: Most cellular functions require large forces that can be only generated collectively by a team of many motors. (Mallik, 2013)

**Fact 2**: The substrate on which motor teams must assemble inside cell is usually a lipid membrane.

**Hypothesis 1**: Motor recruitment to a lipid membrane can be controlled by the membrane itself.

**Factor 3**: Lipid rafts are enriched in specific proteins.

**Hypothesis 2**: Lipid rafts control the motor recruitment to a lipid membrane.

**Factor 4**: EP -> bidirected transport, LP -> rapid dynein-driven transport toward the MT minus end

**Hypothesis 3**: Lipid rafts on the phagosome membrane could upregulate dynein-driven transport of phagosomes.

## Conclusion ##

## Proof ##

### EP Moves Bidirected and LP Moves Unidirected ###

### Increase in Frequency and Magnitude of Minus-end-Directed Force Generating Events on LPs ###

The conclusion is achieved by the optical trapping experiment to measure forces.

The histogram of the force of EP and LP moving along MT towards **plus** end has two peaks: 6pN and 12pN. The force of a kinesin is ~6pN. Thus, one or two kinesins function.

The histogram of the force of EP and LP moving along MT towards **minus** end has peaks at 4pN, 6pN, 8pN, 10pN, 12pN, 14pN and 16pN. The force of a dynein is ~1pN, and dyneins are recruited in pairs. Thus, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 dyneins function.
