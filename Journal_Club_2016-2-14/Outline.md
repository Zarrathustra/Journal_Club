# Dynein Clusters into Lipid Microdomains on Phagosomes to Drive Rapid Transport toward Lysosome #

## Syntax ##

* EP: Early Phagosome
* LP: Late Phagosome

## Facts and Hypotheses ##

**Fact 1**: Most cellular functions require large forces that can be only generated collectively by a team of many motors. (Mallik, 2013)

**Fact 2**: The substrate on which motor teams must assemble inside cell is usually a lipid membrane.

**Hypothesis 1**: Motor recruitment to a lipid membrane can be controlled by the membrane itself.

**Factor 3**: Lipid rafts are enriched in specific proteins.

**Hypothesis 2**: Lipid rafts control the motor recruitment to a lipid membrane.

**Factor 4**: EP -> bidirected transport, LP -> rapid dynein-driven transport toward the MT minus end

**Hypothesis 3**: Lipid rafts on the phagosome membrane could upregulate dynein-driven transport of phagosomes.
